Lesson 12. Video What is an electromagnetic wave Sunny's Classroom. EM spectrum.
One cycle/second is a hertz "Hz". 
Waves become 1s and 0s by changes in amplitude, frequency, and/or phase.
Frequency bands common WLAN frequency bands are: 2.4 GHz, 5GHz, and 6 GHz.
802.11 wifi standards: VeEX WiFi Air Expert Part 1: Wi-Fi Standard Overview video. 
Frequency bands subdivided into small segments called channel.
Channels allow devices to simultaneously communicate within the same frequency band.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum uses narrow frequency band and hops data signals in short data bursts transmitted in a predictable squence from frequency to frequency.
Sunny's Classroom video on FDM and OFDM. 2.4 GHz channels need to use 1,6 and 11 (non-overlapping channels). 
The higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.
