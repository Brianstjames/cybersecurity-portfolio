On the 21st of March after reviewing Module 6 we jumped into Module 7 which was Process Management.
Processors (CPUs) are installed on the motherboard. They determine the system's computer power. Major mfg. are Intel and AMD.
Processors operate using internal clock that is the same or a multiple of the motherboard's bus speed measured in gigahertz (GHz); also called "frequency".
We also learned a process is a program loaded in memory and running. They are instances of running code.
Process architecture processes at 32 or 64 bits at a time.
Threads are subprograms which share space in a process. They are also called instructions.
We also discussed Linux Multitasking where Linux can run multiple processes at the same time with 1 CPU.
Another term for system process is a daemon process which are is started by the operating system.
All processes are directly or indirectly loaded by one single process called systemd or init in older Linus distros.
We talked about Process number using process ID (PID) and parent process ID (PPID).
We discussed Process Display Viewing using commands Top, PS, and HTOP.
