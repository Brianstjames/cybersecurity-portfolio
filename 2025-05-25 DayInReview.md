Cont. Exam Practice 3 Network Operations |
- A critical sytem service failure can have immediate and widespread impact on the organization's operations, potentially affecting all users and critical processes (#7). Addressing this first ensures that essential services are restored to maintain business continuity.
- All alerts are important, resources are often limited, and alerts must be prioritized based on their impact.
- Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., forbes.sales.realty.com.) consists of the hostname and a domain suffix. In this domain, forbes is the hostname and the domain suffix is sales.realty.com. The suffix .com is the top-level domanin. In this domain, realty and sales are domain names within the top-level domain .com(.) respectively.
- The Secure Erase command on Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) performs a single pass of zero-filling, effectively overwriting the data. Solid State Drives (SSDs) marking all blocks as empty allows the drive firmware's garbage collectors to erase each block over time, making data recovery difficult. This method ensures data is securely erased while allowing the drives to be reused. Quick format does not securely erase data; it only removes the file system's pointers to the data. Deleting files and emptying the recycle bin does not remove the data from the drive; it only marks the space as available for use.
- Failing to manage credentials properly for a jump box can lead to exploitation by malicious actors, as weak or compromised credentials can provide unauthorized access to the network and its resources.
- Tabletop exercises are discussions of hypothetical disaster scenarios to evaluate the organization's response plans, identify gaps in knowledge, communication, and coordination, and strengthen incident response capabilities.
- Application logs - record data for specific services or applications running on the system. System logs - record startup events and changes to the configuration at an Operating System (OS) level, but they do not provide detailed information about specific application activities. Audit logs - focus on recording success or failure of authentication and authorization attempts. Useful for tracking access, but does not provide specific details about application behavior. Performance/Traffic logs - record metrics for compute, storage, and network resources over time. A spike in resources could indicate unauthorized activity, performance/traffic logs do not identify the application/service responsible.
- Syslog server - centralized logging service. Network admins configure network devices to redirect logging messages (regardless of severity level) to a/the Syslog server. This allows the network admin to view all log messages from all devices from a single location.
- IP Address Management (IPAM) software scans DHCP and DNS servers and IP address usage to a database. This helps in maintaining visibility into IP address assignments and name resolution across different infrastructures. IPAM can also manage and reconfigure DHCP and DNS severs remotely.
- Implementing state/bare metal backups, which create a snapshot-type image of the whole system, ensures that you can quicky restore a device to its last operational state, including configurations and any temporary state information. This provides a comprehensive recovery solution. Backing up configuration files is important, but it may not capture temporary state information. Keeping a written log of all configuration changes is useful for record-keeping.
- Hostnames are translated into IP addresses by DNS severs.
- DHCPv6 clients use port 546 and DHCPv6 servers use port 547. DHCPv4 clients use port 68 and DHCPv4 servers use port 67.
- Iterative lookups involve a DNS server responding with either the requested information or a referral to another server closer to the authoritative source. Recursive sever queries is when a server queries other severs until it finds the requested record or times out.
- Configuring a PTR record for the reversed IP address format (40.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa) pointing to the mail server's domain can help improve the reputation of the mail server by allowing reverse DNS lookups to confirm the domain name associated with the sending IP address. This is a common requirement for email delivery systems to reduce spam. MX records are used to specify the mail server responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain.
