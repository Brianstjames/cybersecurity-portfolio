April the 2 was professional development day so Mr. Ron Cofield held court and we reviewed our three (3) positves and two (2) not positive things.
My three (3) positives are: I excel at explaining concepts I have a grasp of to others, passion for the things I'm interested in, and I hold myself and others to a high standard.
My two (2) negatives are: I occasionally overcommit, believing I can handle everthing (but I'm learning to not do it), and I can come across as pollyannish at times and can sometimes come acress as overly idealistic. But I aim to temper it with pragmatism.
My career aspiration is I'm currently drawn to application security engineering, though I remain open to evolving paths in cybersecurity.
