Lesson 11.1 Zone-Based Security. What is an Air Gap? Video. Air Gapping and Cybersecurity. Security bubble which are physically separated from othe devices. What is a DMZ powercert video.
Sunny's Classroom Video DMZ and Honeynet. We establish DMZ because we want to facilitate public access. Honeynet is a faux network used to bait hackers.
WAF web application firewall is a proxy. Honeynets observe Tactic, Techniques and Procedures (TTP). Triple homed - firewall/router appliance with three or more NICs. NIC placement: interfaces for public (Internet) zone, private (Lan) zone, and Perimeter zone = same configuration as screened subnet.
Sunny's Classroom Video IDS & IPS - Intrusion Detection system - passive system that scans incoming traffic.
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) blocks intrusion. Combined into a UTM and next generation firewall.
IoT Embedded Systems - special computer that combines CPU, Ram, storage, and I/O for a dedicatd function. read only memory (ROM). System generally is static, which does not allow or require frequent changes.
PACS and Smart Buildings - Programmable Logic Controllers = specialized computer designed to operate in industrial settings for automation & control. Contains: CPU, RAM, I/O, and etc. pg. 7
Industrial Embedded Systems -
Operational Technology (OT) networks - cables network for industrial system/applicatins
Geofencing = technology creates virtual geographic boundary around area using location service. The software triggers response when a mobile device enters or leaves a particular area (pg.15).
