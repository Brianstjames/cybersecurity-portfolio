- Electromagnetic interference (EMI) potential causes degradation of data transmission.
- Running data cables close to electrical power cables and fluorescent lights can lead to electromagnetic interference, which disrupts the signal flow within the data cables. This interference can cause data loss, slow transmission speeds, and even network outages.
- Wirless networks often operate on two main frequency bands: 2.4GHz and 5 GHz.
- 5 GHz band offers less interference and higher data rates but has a shorter range than 2.4 GHz.
- 5 GHz devices consume more power due to higher data rates and processing. The primary concern regarding wireless converage is ensuring connectivity and optimal performance.
- 2.4 GHz signals are better at penetrating walls and other physical barriers making it more suitable for coverage over larger areas and through obstacles.
- The customer's router is known as the customer edge (CE).
- The service provider's router is known as the provider edge (PE). Routers serve both to link physically remote networks and subdivide autonomous IP networks into multiple subnets.
- Edge routers designed to work with DSL or cable broadband access methods are known as small office/home office (SOHO) routers.
- Edge routers can perform framing to repackage data from the private LAN frame format to he WAN Internet access frame format.
- WPA2-Personal uses a single passphrase shared among users.
- WPA2-Enterprise uses IEEE 802.1X and EAP to authenticate each user individually against a AAA server enhancing security while also providing individual accountablity, allowing each user's access can be tracked and managed separately.
- WPA3-Enterpise setup, the supplicant (employee's device) requests to join the wireless network, the access point first enables a channel specifically for EAP over Wireless (EAPoW) traffic. This allows the access point to forwardd the supplicant's authentication data to the RADIUS server without granting any other type of network access. This step is crucial for securely authenticating the device before any further network access is allowed.
- The master key (MK) is transmitted from the RADIUS server to the supplicant after successful authentication.
- The RADIUS server sends the pairwise master key (PMK) to the access point. It is derived from the master key (MK) after successful authentication.
- Primary advantage of deploying Layer 3 switches in the core and distribution layers of a network is that they can route traffic between VLANs internally, reducing the need for external routers. This can lead to improved performance and scalability.
- Installing blanking plates in all unused rack slots improves airflow and cooling efficiency within a server room. They prevent the mixing of hot and cold air, ensuring that cool air is directed through active equipment and not wasted on empty spaces. This measure, combined with keeping the lockable doors closed, can significantly enhance cooling efficiency.
- New Power Distribution Units (PDUs) offer remote power monitoring and control capabilities which are essential for modern data centers looking to improve energy efficiency and enhance remote management. These features allow administrators to monitor power usage in real-time, remotely turn power to specific outlets on and off, and manage the power distribution efficiently from any location. PDU's primary funtion is to distribute electrical power to various devices within a rack in a data center. It allows for the centralized management of power supply to multiple pieces of equipment, ensuring they all receive the necessary power from a single source.
- Frequent transitions between blocking and forwarding states indicate that the network is experiencing topology changes, causing STP to recalculate the best paths. Enabling RSTP can significantly reduce convergence times, minimizing disruptions. Configuring the switch as an edge bridge, if applicable, can also help stabilize the network by reducing unnecessary recalculations.
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)  uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate the shortest and most efficient path for routing packets within an autonomous system.
- BGP is primarily used for routing between autonomous systems on the Internet and uses attributes such as AS Path, Local Preference, and MED for path selection.
- RIP uses hop count as its metric for path selection and can only support up to 15 hops.
- EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol which efficiently routes within an autonomous system and has fast convergence times but is Cisco proprietary, which limits hardware options.
-  WPA3's Wi-Fi Enhanced Open provides encryption on open networks without requiring a passphrase. This feature ensures that data transmitted over the network is protected against eavesdropping.
-  WPA2 AES encryption requires a passphrase.
-  WPA TKIP is less secure than WPA3 and requires a passphrase.
-  Routers use dynamic routing protocols to learn about routes from neighboring routers. These learned routes are added to the router's IP routing table if they offer a more efficient path (i.e., they have a lower cost metric) than existing ones. This ensures that the router always uses the most efficient paths for sending data. Dynamic routing protocols automate the process of route learning and selection, and learned routes are managed within the routers themselves.
-  Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) allows for the transmission of multiple data channels over a single or dual fiber strand(s) by using different wavelengths for each channel, thereby increasing the capacity of the fiber without needing additional strands. WDM allows multiple channels to coexist on the same fiber strand. It aims to efficiently use fiber strands to increase capacity and help in reducing overall network latency by optimizing the use of available infrastructure. WDM increases the data transmission rate by alllowing multiple channels to transmit data simultaneously over the same fiber stand.
-  Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) key benefit on a Layer 3 switch for inter-VLAN routing is that they allow for efficient routing between VLANs internally, without the need for traffic to leave the switch. This improves performance and simplifies the network topology. SVIs eliminate the need for external routers for VLAN routing. The benefit of SVIs is about internal routing efficiency.
-  VLANs operate at Layer 2 of the Open System Interconnected Reference Model (OSI model) and are used to segment (reduce) broadcast domains (, not collision domains).
-  Collision domain size is affected by network design and the use of devices like switches and hubs.
-  Network analyzers determine Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes supported along the network path. Adjusting servers' MTU to match the smallest MTU found prevents fragmentation and ensure smooth communication.

-  Combining DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and DoH offers a comprehensive approach to DNS security. DNSSEC ensures the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses, protecting against spoofing and poisoning attacks. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS queries, safeguarding them from interception and tampering, especially important for BYOD and remote access scenarios. This combination addresses both the validation of DNS responses and the encryption of DNS queries, providing a robust security posture.
- Network Time Protocol (NTP) server - If time is off by just a few seconds, slewing is better for putting it back on track. Slewing is a slower, methodical method of correcting time, but the risk of problems occurring is much less. Slamming is used if the time is off by quite a bit and slewing will take too long. While it is a quick and immediate fix, slamming can cause some programs to function improperly. Jitter refers to small, rapid variations in a system's clock. Skew measures the difference (in hertz) between a clock's actual frequency and the frequency necessary to keep a more accurate time.
-  Creating a new scope with more addresses and reducing the lease period can help mitigate issues by ensuring there are enough IP addresses for all devices and that addresses are quickly recycled when devices disconnect from the network.
-  Improperly Decommissioning devices is a significant risk that software licenses could be misused or that configuration information could be leaked.
-  Netflow is specifically designed to collect and report network traffic data. It provides insights into traffic patterns, helping identify bottlenecks and optimize routing, without the need for capturing every packet in full, thus reducing overhead. DHCP is used for dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses. SNMP can be used for network management and monitoring, it does not specifically focus on collecting and reporting traffic flow data as NetFlow.
