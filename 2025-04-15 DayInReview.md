Sunny video Straight through, crossover, rollover - Where & ... cable video. Second video for the day
Straight, cross and rollover cables utp wiring
straight wires goes w/ different layer devices connect. cross wire connects go with same layer devices.
In-band management managing switches through medium. Out-of-band management connects to console port of switch to manage without interfering with other nodes.
Console port on switches use rollover wire scheme to connect.
Routers and PCs use MDI. Switches and hubs use MDIX
Medium dependent interface crossover MDIX
Switches unmanaged and manage ...
Packet (packets are layer 3) Sniffers and Taps. Test access points(TAPs) copies all frames, passive versus active.
Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) is a sensor attached to specific configured port on switch it receives copies of frames addressed to access ports (port mirroring).

Collision domain vs Broadcast domain
Power over Ethernet (PoE) specifies method for supplying electrical power over twisted-pair Ethernet connections (Sunny Video). Standards are 802.3af ~13 W (350mA@48V), 802.3at(PoE+) ~25W (600mA), and 802.3bt(Ultra PoE) ~51 
Wires 1 and 2 Tx, 3 and 6 Rx.W (Type 3) or 73 W (Type 4)
PoE switch is a Power sourcing equipmnet (PSE).
