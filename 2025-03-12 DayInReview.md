Wednesday we had one of the best motivational speakers I know, Mr. Ron Cofield. He was great. We broke down our three (3) core values.
We had another guest speaker before lunch who was just as good, Mr. Paul Farley with TrustedSec. He's a tech guru. He was great!
After lunch we discussed business casual attire so as to clear up any discrepencies.
