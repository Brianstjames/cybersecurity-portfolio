Friday was another informative day to cap-off the week. We started Adams' last day with a game called Space Team that he instructed the class to download and play.
We split up in groups and separated the groups into different areas so as to not share strategies and tactics.
I had my first Get To Know You meeting with Angie.
Afterwards, I rejoined my team and continued with the game until lunch. 
After lunch Adam advised the class as to which group was leading in the scoring. He then advised the class that there were no rules in the game thus we should be creative in terms of getting the highest score possible.
