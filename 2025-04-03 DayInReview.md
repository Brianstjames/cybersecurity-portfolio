Today was a good day we covered Modules 2.1 thru 2.6 of Network+. 
These modules focus on the Physical layer of the OSI Model.
Module 2.1 focused on Network Data Transmission, Ethernet standards, copper cabling and connector types, fiber optic, cabling and connectors.
Module 2.1 also discussed physical installation factors for rack-based installation in server rooms and datacenters.
Module 2.2 drilled down on copper cables and connectors. 
We discussed different types of twisted pair cables including unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP).
Twisted pair connector types are RJ 11, RJ45, GG45, and TERA.
We also discussed Plenum and Riser-Rated Cable, Coaxial Cables and Coaxial Cable Connectors.
In Module 2.3 we discussed Fiber Optic Cable and Connectors. 
Fiber optic cable is the fastest medium for data transmission to date.
In module 2.4 we discussed Wiring Impementation which mainly focuses on Horizontal and Backbone Cabling, along with Demarcation (Demarc),Intermediate Distribution (IDF) and Main distribution Frame (MDF).
Also discussed in this module was Patch Panel and wiring tools and techniques.
Finally, in Module 2.6 we discussed cable troubleshooting.
We focued on identifyiing noise, attentuation, interference, latency, crosstalk interference, impedence, shorts, open circuits and mis-wires.
