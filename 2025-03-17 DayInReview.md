Started off the day reviewing module 3 from Friday where we covered some commands like grep and pipe.
Started Module 4 User Management.
Discussed IAM: Identiy, and Access Management. Main sections are Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
Discussed users, groups, and types: standard and service users. Service users are email servers, database servers, and file servers to name a few.
Learning about /etch/passwd file, /etc/shadow file and the /etc/group file.
Finished the day creating a new user using useradd command.
Since this is an administrative command one must us sudo which translates to superuser do or substitute user do.
These day are packed with a lot of information.
