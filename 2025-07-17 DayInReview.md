Security+ Lesson 6A

- Video Prof. Messer "Cloud Infrastructure"
- Video Powercert "What is Cloud Computing" & "Virtualization"
- Video by "Digital Cloud Training AWS Shared"
- Video Sunny Classroom "Virtualization: Bridged ..." A virtual machine is file sitting on a hard-drive per Sunny.
- Video RapidScale "Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Explained" (pg. 25 of slides.)
- Video by AWS Whiteboarding Virtural Private Cloud (VPC)
- Video Powercert Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Video by ACI Learning "Virtual Machines vs Containers - Which is right for you?"
- Video by IBM VM vs Container & VM vs. Docker
- Video by SimplyExplained What is an API 

VPC is a cloud data center

Cloud Deployment Models
- Security Consderations
  1. Dedicated infrastucture to a single customer
  2. "only that customer can access the infrastructure"

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
1. hardware and netword infrastructure devices are provided 'virtually'.
2. avoids purchasing and managing

Multi-tenant architecture
1. Multiple customers "share" the SAME infrastucture

MySQL is a database consisting of tables and records. Use generic browser like Firefox (frontend) trying to access database use API to tap into database.

Virtulization allows for multiple virtual machines on a powerful computer called a server.

Playing a video on Amazon is a micro-service

Cloud Computing popular platforms:
aws
azure
google cloud
alibaba
IBM

Computer Basic Components = Processor, Ram, Storage (hard drive), NIC - network interface card.

Desktop as a Service (DaaS) = virtualization in the cloud; Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) = virtualization done on premise.

Kernel is the core of an operator system, then drivers, and etc.

VM vs. Container
VM = virtualizes Hardware
Container = virtualizes O/S

- Infrastructure as a Service pg.7 (IaaS) = hardware and network infrastructure devices are provided virtually
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) = delivers everything a developer needs to build an application on the cloud infrastructure
- Software as a Service (SaaS) = delivers software applications to the client either over the internet or on a local area network.

- High Availability (HA) = guarantee 99.99% uptime or better

- pg. 20 Virtualization platform
  1. Host hardware
     a. physical computer ("host") running (hosting) a VM

  VDI pg.25
  1. storing images of clients (OS + applications) on a central server

pg. 27 Application Virtualization
1. user accesses app hosted on server or streams the app from the server to client
2. does not run the whole client desktop image
