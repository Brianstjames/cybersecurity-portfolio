The class took a trip out Cox Enterprises where two graduates from the City of Refuge/NPursuit Cybersecurity program hosted the class.
It was an amazing experience touring the building and meeting the two graduates who now work for a large corporation like that.
I very much appreciate City of Refuge and NPursuit for the opportunity. I had a blast.
