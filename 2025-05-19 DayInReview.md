Lesson 14.0 Virtualization and Containers. Virtualization pg.2 Hypervisor is VMware Workstation. Host - physical computer running ("hosting") the virtual machine. Two types of Hypervisors Type 1 and Type 2.
We are running Hypervisor 2 which sits atop Windows 11. In the professional world Type 1 is used where it sits in place of the operating system (Windows 11 e.g.).
Virtual Machine vs. Containers Powercert Video. Virtual machines consume a lot of disk space, ram, computer power, slow to start, and requires a license for each operating system.
Ngnix runs web servers. Instructor mentioned it.
Container Virtualization - software runs apps and dependencies is an isolated "cell". Each cell shares same OS but separated from other cells. OS creates "Application cells". Removes the idea of a hypervisor ("VM").
IBM Virtual Machine (VM) vs Docker Video.
Lesson 14.1 Datacenter and Storage Networks. Types of servers: destop rack and blade. Datacenter Network Design: Traffic Flow north-south is traffic going to and from datacenter. East-west traffic - traffic going between servers in datacenter pg. 5.
Zero Trust Architecture - ... Spine and Leaf Topology.
Sunny Classroom DAS, NAS, & SAN video. Data Storage: DAS Direct-Attached Stroage - storage directly attached to host, NAS Network Attached Storage - storage connected to production switch, SAN Storage Area Network - (is a server's network) separates storage resources from the local network, dedicated network providing access to block-level data storage, and servers are connected to storage devices via dedicated LAN separated from production network (pg. 10, 11). 
Storage: magnetic, SSD, Hybrib. Connector interfaces PATA, SCSI cable, SATA, NVME.
Powercert Video "What is RAID 0,1,5, & 10?". Redundant Array of Independent Disk. Raid 0 -. Raid 1 requires 2 disks, one mirrows the other. Raid 5 requires 3 or more disks. Raid 10 requires 4 disks which mirrow like Raid 1 and strip like Raid 0.
Lesson 14.2 Cloud Concepts Cloud Basics - cloud computing is software, data access , computation, and storage services provided to clients through the Internet pg. 2 (on Test).
Scalability ability to increase workload size by adding resources, i.e., the ability to handle growing amount of work: manual, planned, and predictive. Types of scaling: vertical and horizontal. Elasticity pg.4 - abiltiy to automatically adjust and allocate computing resources on demand: automatic, unplanned, and reactive.
Cloud Deployment Models - Public (multi-tenant) service offered over the Internet by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to consumers, Private Cloud IT Group likey manages the cloud (i.e. in-house Service Provider) other Business Units are the client, Hosted Private Cloud, Community Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud.
Cloud Service Models - Cloud Categories - Traditional all hardware, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
