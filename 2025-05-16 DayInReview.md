SIEM, or Security Information and Event Management, is a cybersecurity solution that collects and analyzes security data from various sources within a network in real-time. It helps organizations detect and respond to potential security threats by aggregating logs and events, providing a centralized view of security incidents.

CATE5e TIA-568B Cable Color Order.
VPN Types: Site to Site, Client to Site, and Commercial.
Tunneling Protocols: PPP, PPTP, GRE, IKEv2 / IPeSc, L2TP / IPSec, TLS / DTLS, SSTP, Open / Wireguard.
IPv6 uses IPSec (it's built-in) both are at the Network layer.
IP addresses and Mac addresses are stripped as packets are resloved at router.
SSH/TLS security for browser.
IPSec - encryption protocol suite that defines rules for encryption, authentication, and key management for TCP/IP transmissions pg. 12.
IPSec modes - Transport mode: secure communication between two hosts. And Tunnel mode: runs on routers or other devices, communication between VPN gateways accoss unsecure network (Internet) "router implementation".
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is associated with the tunnel of the VPN pg. 17,18.
Client-to-Site Private Networks: Split vs. Full Tunnel on Test pg. 22 Lesson 13.2. 
Clientless VPN - allows access to network resources via web browser pg.24.
