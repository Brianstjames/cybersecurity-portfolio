- netstat (short for network statistics) is a command-line tool used to display detailed information about a computer's network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. nslookup - Windows command-line tool used to display DNS information, not as thorough as dig (which is a Linux command-line tool native. ping command test for connectivity. tracert - command tracks hops. 
-ARP LAN has an ip address but is looking for the mac address. ACLs Access Control list is table on a firewall filter. They filter packets based on parameters like ip address, mac addresses, port numbers, and etc.
NAC Network Access Control - is a security  solution that enforces policies on devices trying to access a network, ensuring only authorized  and compliant devices can connect.
SVI Switched Viritual interface - is a virtual interface on a Layer 3 switch that provides routing and Layer 3 IP connectivity to VLANs (Virtual LANs). 
IDS detection - intrusion detection system is a security tool  that monitors network traffic or system activities to identify and alert on potential malicious behavior, policy violations, or security threats.
NFV network functions virtualization - is a network architecture concept that replaces traditional, hardware-based networking devices (like routers, firewalls, and load balancers) with virtualized software instances running on standard servers.
Enable spanning tree - activating Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or its variants (RSTP, MSTP) on a network switch to prevent loops in Ethernet networks while ensuring redundancy.

 - protocol field value of 17 indicates UDP, which is not primarily used for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
 - protocol field value of 1 indicates ICMP which is used for diagnostic and control purposes.
 - protocol field value of 2 indicates IGMP, which is used for managing multicast group memberships.
 - SD-WAN Software-Defined Wide Area Network -
 - Network Level Authentication (NLA) adds layer of security by requiring authentication before establishing a session, thus protecting against unauthorized access and denial of service attacks.
 - Secure Administrative Workstation (SAW) - minimizes the risk of connecting from a compromised or low-security device, further enchancing the security of the remote desktop connection.
  
- A /21 CIDR notation can summarize eight contiguous /24 networkd into a single network. This is because a /21 network encompasses 2^11 = 2048 addresses, and since each /24 network represents 256 addrsses, eight of them would total 2048 addresses.
- Ques. 15 Review VPNs
- A master image is the "gold" copy of a VM or container instance, with the OS, applications, and patches all installed and configured. It serves as a ready-to-deploy snapshot of a system's desired state.
- TLS Transport Layer Security transport encryption is used to secure data as it is transmitted over the network, protecting it from interception and unauthorized access.
- The Applicatin layer (layer 7) of the OSI model is where application protocols operate, and firewalls operating at this lyer can inspect the contents of application protocol headers and payloads to make filtering decisions. This allows for a more granular control over the types of data allowed or blocked.
- The Transport layer (layer 4) deals with the transmission of data segments between points on a network, not with parsing application data.
- The Data link layer (layer 2) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and does not inspect application protocol headers or payloads.
- The Physical layer (layer 1) deals with the physical transmission of data over a network medium and does not involve parsing data at the application level.
