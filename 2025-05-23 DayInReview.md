  protocol field value of 17 indicates UDP, which is not primarily used for HTTP and HTTPS traffic;
  protocol field value of 1 indicates ICMP which is used for diagnostic and control purposes, not for transporting web browsing data.
  protocol field value of 2 indicates IGMP, which is used for managing multicast group memberships, not for web browsing traffic.
  SD-WAN Software-Defined Wide Area Network -
  Network Level Authentication (NLA) adds layer of security by requiring authentication before establishing a session, thus protecting against unauthorized access and denial of service attacks.
  Secure Administrative Workstation (SAW) - minimizes the risk of connecting from a compromised or low-security device, further enchancing the security of the remote desktop connection.
  
Ques. 10 /21 CIDR notation can summarize eight contiguous /24 networkd into a single network.
Ques. 15 Review VPNs
A master image is the "gold" copy of a VM or container instance, with the OS, applications, and patches all installed and configured.
It serves as a ready-to-deploy snapshot of a system's desired state.
TLS Transport Layer Security transport encryption is used to secure data as it is transmitted over the network, protecting it from interception and unauthorized access.
The Applicatin layer (layer 7) of the OSI model is where application protocols operate, and firewalls operating at this lyer can inspect the contents of application protocol headers and payloads to make filtering decisions. 
This allows for a more granular control over the types of data allowed or blocked.
The Transport layer (layer 4) deals with the transmission of data segments between points on a network, not with parsing application data.
The Data link layer (layer 2) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and does not inspect application protocol headers or payloads.
The Physical layer (layer 1) deals with the physical transmission of data over a network medium and does not involve parsing data at the application level.
