#About Me

Name: Brian S. Ayiteyfio

Hometown: Decatur, GA

Prior IT Experience:

A few years ago I embarked on a career in IT where I enrolled in a part-time web development bootcamp. The program was good and I learned a lot but I wasn't satisfied so last summer I enrolled in a Data Analytics program training in Power Bi which was excellent - but I came to realize it was not the right fit for me. I believe Cybersecurity is the right fit for me because of its variety of specialties and job opportunities. 

Career Plans:

My goal is to become a cybersecurity expert specializing in cloud security and network security. I would be honored to work with any firm. After completing this cybersecurity course I will gain foundational experience and secure a role such as security analyst. This will allow me to build the technical expertise and hands-on knowledge required for more advanced positions.

Proud Project/Task:

During my web development training we had a project we had to do. I worked with two other classmates in the project. We were from different backgrounds and cultures but we banded together for the sake of the project and got it done. I am proud of that because it speaks to professionalism. We also communicated well with each other and contributed equitably.
