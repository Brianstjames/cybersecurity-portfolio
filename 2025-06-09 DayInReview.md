Chapter 1 Programming and Python
Program set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task. Commonly referred to as Software.
Motherboard has cpu, ram, bios/uefi, storage (magnet, ssd, hybrid), interface (pata,scsi,sata,nvme/m.2)

Video Computer Science basics: Programming Languages by Learn Free. C++ is a good language for graphics.
- Levels of Program Code: High Level Language (C++, Python, Java), Assembly Language (ARM, MIPS, x86), Machine Language.
- Tom's Introduction to Computer Programming for Computers. Machine code is binary series of 1's and 0's. Assembly ?, C, C++, Java, C#, Objective-C. Android uses Java. Objective-C on Mac.
- Data Types: integer: 1,2, or 3. Float: Decimal i.e., 1.2, 2.3. Character: any ASCII character. String: Hello world. An array of characters. Boolean: True False. Loops: For, while. Conditions: If, ... Functions of Methods: Mini programs within a program. Classes/objects: reusable building blocks of a program.
- Intro to x86 Assembly Language (Part 1) by Davy Wybiral Video. Assembly language is tied to its processor not portable in other words. Focus x86. The Stack ... LIFO data structure, Is an array, Stack pointer,

- register is a spot on the ram chip or working registry
- Assembly Language is a direct substitute for machine language. both assembly and machine languages are considered low level languages.
- Assembler computer  program that translates assembly language into machine language and uses the CPU's instruction set to translate.

  - Higher Programming Languages - any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context. High-level language must be translated (compiled/interpreted) into machine language before being executed by the computer. Portable, machine independent. Examples:
  - Video on diffences between Assembly, Compiled, and Interpreted languages -- low to high respectively. ALU
- Video (old school) by Bits and Bytes TVO "Interpreters and Compilers (Bits and Bytes, Episode 6)"
- Coding mentors Video "Compiler and Interpreter: Compiled Language vs Interpreted Programming Languages" Compiled programs are not portable but interpreted programs can.
- Compiler on pg. 8, Interpreter on page 9, and source code is on page 10.
- Pseudocode is step-by-step description of an algorithm, "fake code" uses simple language  text as it intended for human understanding rather than machine reading.
- Python pg. 14. dynamic, high-level, free
