Sunny Videos Analog vs Digital and Analog to digital conversion via Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).
Data link layer deals with managing device communication.
Multiplexing allows multiple devices share one medium. Sunny Video on Multipexing How does cellular network work. Multiple signals are combined together. Most important aspect is sharing vis a vis Multiplexing. Baseband TDM digital signal and statistacal TDM.
Broadband is an Analog system and uses Frequency FDM.
First rule was polling with dumb terminals and mainframes. Then the Token was created. Then they came up with Ethernet which is LAN based.

Powercert Video "Modem vs Router". Switches and Access points (AP's) move frames, learn mac addresses but differ because one is wired and the other is wireless. 
Data Link layer moves frames. Network layer transfers packets.
