- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key practice in cloud computing that allows infrastructure (servers, networks, storage, etc.) to be defined, provisioned, and managed using code or scripts rather than manual processes.
- Tagging (or frame/packet tagging) is method of adding metadata to network traffic to identify and manage data flows. Metadata is defines data as in: who created the data?, when was it created/modified?, where is it stored or used?, and how should it be processed?
- LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) is a protocol used to automatically bundle multiple physical network links into a single logical link (called a LAG or EtherChannel) for: increased bandwidth (e.g., 2 x 1Gbps links = 2Gbps aggregate), redundancy (failover if one link fails), and load balancing (traffic distributed across links).
- Fibre Channel Storage Area Network (SAN), WorldWide Names (WWNs) are globally unique identifiers assigned to devices such as initiators (hosts) and targets (storage devices). These identifiers are similar in concept to MAC addresses in Ethernet networks.
- In cloud systems, scalability refers to the ability to increase or decrease resources as needed. Cloud providers often offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, where you only pay for whay you use. Therefore, costs typically increse proportionally (linearly) as you scale resources or may increase less than linearly due to ecomomies of scale, discounts for reserved instances, or efficiency gains from elastic resource mangaemnt.
- A Data Center is a facility designed to house computer systems, networking equipment, and storage systems. Its primary purpose is to provide reliable hosting and management of networking services, applications, data storage, and server resources for organizations. It ensures high availability, security, and efficient operation of IT infrastructure.
- Public cloud offers cost-effective, on-demand scalability without the need for upfront investment in hardware. They provide reasonable security measures suitable for data that is not highly sensitive. Private or hosted private clouds tend to be more costly and complex, and hybrid clouds are often used when there's a need to mix sensitive and non-sensitive workloads.
- In spine and leaf topology, spine switches are not directly connected to each other. Instead, each leaf switch connects to every spine switch. Spine switches never connect to other spine switches or to leaf switches direclty - only leaf-to-spine connections exist.
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables centralized control of the network through a controller, allowing dynamic and automated configuration of network resources. Central policy management allows admins to define and adjust network policies in a central location, which can then be enforced across the entire network in real-time.
- Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify," with an emphasis on behavioral analytics to detect potential threats. Unusual access patterns, such as attempting to access sensitive documents outside of typical hours, trigger alerts. Denying access and alerting the security team aligns with ZTA's proactive stance on security, ensuring that potential breaches are investigated before harm occurs.
- When two systems have duplicate IP addresses, a race condition occurs, meaning that the network traffic intended for that IP address could be received by either of the two systems unpredictably. This situation is problematic and can lead to inconsistent network behavior. Manual intervention is required.
- The ip link show command is the most appropriate for the engineer's needs because it displays detailed information about each network interface, including its operational status (up or down) and MAC address, among other details. This command allows the engineer to quickly verify that the network interfaces are active and ready for communication, which is crucial for the VMs to interact within the same subnet. ip addr list command provides information about the IP addresses assigned to each network interface but does not focus on the operational status of the interfaces. It is useful for verifying IP configurations. ip route show command displays the kernel routing tables, which is helpful for understanding how traffic is routed through the network. ip -s link command reports detailed statistics about network interfaces, such as the number of packets transmitted and received.
- Packet loss and jitter directly impact the quality of real-time applications like VoIP. Packet loss occurs when packets of data being transmitted across a network fail to reach their destination, which can be due to network congestion, faulty hardware, or other issues. Jitter involves the variation in packet delay, causing packets to arrive out of sequence.
- netstat command run on Linux without any switches displays active connections of all types, making it a versatile tool for quickly checking network activity. On Windows, netstat without switches specifically shows active TCP connections.
- netstat(sp)-an switch dispalys all connections and listening ports in numerical form. netstat(sp)-s switch displays network activity statistics for TCP, UDP, and IP. On Windows, the -o switch shows the Process ID (PID) that has opened each port. The -r switch dispays the routing table. netstat(sp)-a displays open ports, including both TCP and UDP connections and ports in the listening state. 
- Never look directly into an active transceiver or the end of a fiber cable because the poweful light sources used in fiber optics can cause serious eye injury if viewed directly. This is why it's important to wear appropriate safety googles.
- A switch's total power budget is exceeded due to the additon of more WAP's, some devices may not receive consistent power, leading to intermittent connectivity issues.
- Domain Information Groper (dig) command is a powerful Domain Name System (DNS) troubleshooting tool used in networking to query DNS servers and retrieve detailed information about domain names, IP addresses, DNS records, and DNS server responses. It is native to Linux systems but can be can work on Windows via WSL or third-party installs. nslookup for Windows is similar but dig is more poweful. nbstat command is to view information on NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) name resolution. ping to test connectivity between networks.
- High error rates may indicate a problem with the device drivers or hardware connected to those parts.
- Signal attenuation occurs with increased distance and potential physical obstrutions (e.g., walls, furniture) can cause signal attenuation in wireless networks.
- Broadcast storm is caused by looped connection, e.g. connecting two ports on the same switch with a patch cable.
- The attenuation rate of the fiber type and the wavelength used are critical factors in calculating the optical link budget. Different types of fiber and wavelengths have different attenuation rates, which directly affect the amount of signal loss over distance.
-  In the context of cable links, a decibel (dB) measures the insertion loss, which is the ratio of the received voltage to the original voltage. This helps in understanding how much signal degradation has occurred.
-  Giant frame errors occur when a frame exceeds the maximum permissible size. If a host is configured to send jumbo frames but the switch interface is not configured to accept them, the frames will be considered too large, resulting in giant frame errors.
-  show arp command is to view the ARP cache on a router. This command displays the ARP table, which contains the IP addresses resolved to MAC addresses, allowing the administrator to identify any duplicate IP addresses or other ARP-related issues. arp(sp)-a command is used on Windows and Linux hosts to display the ARP cache, not on routers. ip neigh show command is used on Linux systems to display the ARP table (neighbor table), not on router. show ip route command is used to display the routing table on a router, not the ARP cache, and would not help in identifying duplicate IP addresses.
-  The end node is expected to reply with an ICMP Port Unreachable response, indicating that the probe has reached its final destination. ICMP Echo Reply is typically the response to and ICMP Echo Request. ICMP Destination Unreachable indicates that a network or host cannot be reached. ICMP Time Exceeded is expected from intermediate nodes when the TTL of a probe expires.
