Lesson 1.1 Module 1 Explaining Network Topologies. Lesson 1.1 Networking Overview is where we stated today.
Client-Server Networks - applications resources are centrally provisioned, managed and secured.
Client nodes consume the services provided by servers. Nodes are dedicated to a client or to a server role.
Advantages are easy to expand, easy to support, centralized administration, and easy to backup. The disadvantages are expensive server operating system and expensive advance planning required.
Peer-to-peer Networks each host can provide resources to other hosts, access resources on other hosts and control access to their resources. Disadvantages are difficult to expand, difficult to support, lacks centralized control, no centralized strorage and sucurity issues.
Local area networks (LAN) are confined to a single geographic location.
Network Topology - Physical topology describes the placement of nodes and how they are connected. 
Logical Topology is how the data flows or is transmitted thru the network.
Point-to-Point (PPP) topology is when two nodes (workstations) are directly connected thru wire or wireless.
Bus topology is when nodes are directly connected to a "trunk" cable. The bus or trunk is either logical or physical.
Ring topology is when each node connects to its neighboring device until a ring is created. Each node will repeat a signal when its sent out.
Star topology each node is connected to a central device called a hub or switch.
Mesh topology has no central connecting point, any node can communicate directly with any other node and if a link fails, the data has an alternate route to its destination.
Partial mesh topology is defined by only some redundant paths exist. This is less expensive and time consuming and still allowing for fault tolerance.
Last you have the Hybrid Network Topology which a mixture of point-to-point, bus, ring, star, and mesh.
