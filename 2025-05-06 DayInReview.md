Lesson 10.1 Authentication Watching video of Sunny's Classroom 
Three types of Authentication: What you know e.g., password. what you have eg token - one-time password. what you are eg biometrics. 4.What you do, eg, voice recognition. 5. Where you are, eg. geolocation.
Multi-factor Authentication - password in combination with one-time passcode. IBM Authentication video. Authentication: something you know, somethin you have, and somethin you are.
Single Sign-On (SSO) has a Centralized Authorization system.
Local authorization is signing into your operating sytem. Hash is integrity - ensuring email is received w/o alteration, symmetric: one key, and aysmmetric is two keys established by the sender..
Jack the Riper hacks passwords as long you as you know the algorithm e.g.: MD5.
Central Authentication Server (CAS) - PKI, Kerberos, Radius, TACACS+, LDAP/Active Directory (AD)
Symmetric single shared key utilizes encryption RC5, AES, DES, 3DES.
The most widely used Asymmetric algorithm is RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).
Video by Simple Explained A symmetric ... and video by Securemetric What is Public Key Infrastructure Video.
know for test Hash not encription, integrity, MDS, family of SHA non-reversible.
symmetic encryption single key, RC5, AES, DES, 3DES.
Asymmetric encription DEH RSA, ECC, two keys pub., priv.
Public key is to authenticate via asymmetric encryption. Private key is never shared by owner.
Kerberos Sunny Video designed for security and authentication. Key distribution center two servers:
Kerberos uses tickets (as in fair) to use services/servers. Ticket Granting ticket service (TGT). Key Distribution Center (KDC) authenticates user logon request (principles).
Sunny Classroom video AAA Framework: Authentication, Authorization Accounting. Radius is remote authentication dial-in user. It's a protocol explaination starts on pg. 25 Lesson 10.1 ... 
Radius and TACACs Sunny's Classroom video.
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows users & apps to find info on people, files, software, devices, and organizations within network. Active Directory by Microsoft spins from LDAP.
All these are different ways to Authenticate. Another way is 802.1X aka NAC and EAP Extended Authentiction Protocol (video by Mushraf Mustafa) EAP = clear credentials such as passwords etc.
