Lesson 5C

Old School authentication & authentication - was remote access server pg. 2

pg. 3 VPN does two things: creates a tunnel, then encrypt end to end via shared key(s).
- VPN - setup a secure network inside another network. They can be configured to firewall.

Models: 
- client-to-site -
- site-to-site -
- host-to-host -
- commercial -

Protocols
- PPP point-to-point - no security mechanisms (must use other protocols to provide security - deprecated)
- PPTP
- TLS VPN = openVPN; MS SSTP; build in encryption.

L2TP = is just a the tunnel; encryption added is IPsec.
IKE (pg.12) = is a tunnel and deals with phases.
  
- Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS version 1.2,1.3) VPN - this protocol uses the browser. pg.7

- Transport mode - host-to-host connection on a private network.

- Tunnel Mode - communication between VPN gateways across unsecure network (Internet

VPN Client Configuration

- Split Tunnel = client accesses the internet directly using its "native" IP configuration and DNS servers. You

- Full Tunnel = Internet access mediated by corporate network
