The 19th was a professional development day.
We had the pleasure of having Ron for the day and we did our enneagrams.
I turned out to be an 8 but, I don't think I fit most of the characteristics of and 8.
We also had the pleasure of having Mr. Donevan "Don" Howard to speak to the class.
He is a former studend of City of Refuge and is a perfect inspiration to the class.
He is a application security engineer.
He explained to us some of the tools he uses now to do his job.
The tools he explained to us were sast, dast, and sca.
Overall great day.
