Security+ Lesson 6A (cont'd)

Cloud Architecture 
pg. 5

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) = is a isolated private network within a public cloud.

STATUS CODE: 
- 200 SUCCESS
- 400 CLIENT 
- 404 ERROR URL NOT FOUND

Video by FlowInData "What is SOAP"

API pg. 6 
- mechanism allow two app components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols
- software-to-software interfaces
- i.e. allow diffent apps to connect and exchange information or functionality


Simple Object Access Protocol API (SOAP)
- uses XML format 
- extensions in form of Web Services (WS) standards
- tightly specified protocol; SOAP request sent must use XML doc
- used in the financial industry

Representational State Transfer API (REST)
- loose architecture framework
- "RESTful API"
- sent with HTTP operation/verb (e.g. GET or POST)
- each resource (noun endpoint) accessed as URLs

Microservices pg. 7
Video by 5 Minutes Tech "Microservices Explained in 5 Minutes"

- An architectural approach to building software applications as a collection of small and independent services focusing on a specific business capability
- Process:
  a. Developer breaks down all features and functions of the application into separate services.

Serverless Architecture pg.8 
  - Video by IBM "What is Serverless"
  - developers build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure
  - "build and run apps without thinking about services"
  - no server or code to manage
  - customer pays for execution time only (no idle time)

Video by IBM Technology "What is FaaS (Function as a Service)?

Funciton-as-a-Service (FaaS) pg. 9
- run code module (functions) of an application on the fly
- no concern for the backend infrastructure or system requirements

Backend as a Service (BaaS)
- entire backend (database, storage, etc.) of a system is handled independently and offered as a service

Infrastructure as Code (IoC)
- software engineering practice manages computing infrastructure using machine-readable definition files
- (On Test) Machine readable definition files written:
  1. YAML, JSON
  2. HCL (Hashcorp Configuration Language) used Terrafom/Consul

Kubernetes (k8s) = is a container in the cloud

Video Udacity 

"Advantages of SDN ..." pg.13 6A (cont'd)

Software Defined Networking = decouple network control logic from the devices performing the function (e.g., switches, routers)
- network control logic = controls movement of information in the underlying network
- Physical and virtual app

Network Function Virtualization (NFV)  pg. 13 and 14  a subset security devices

Video TECHtalk "What is Software-Defined Networking (SDN)"

3 planes:
- Control plane =
- Data plane =
- Management plane = 

NFV pg. 14

pg.16  SLA and ISA

Security+ Lesson 6B

System on Chip - SoC pg.4 (On Test)

pg.20 Controller area network (CAN)
 - serial

Zero Trust?
Data Dog, Prometheus?





Lesson 6B pg. 6
IT is probabalistic (like the booting up a movie on Netflix, might not work)

Operational Technology (OT) is Deterministic (action must work)

6B pg. 11 & 12 Industrial Control Systems
