Video by CodeWithMzn What is API? (Application Programming Interface)
Video by FlowInData "What is SOAP"

Simple Object Access Protocol API (SOAP)
- uses XML format 
- extensions in form of Web Services (WS) standards
- tightly specified protocol; SOAP request sent must use XML doc
- used in the financial industry

Representational State Transfer API (REST)
- loose architecture framework
- "RESTful API"
- sent with HTTP operation/verb (e.g. GET or POST)
- each resource (noun endpoint) accessed as URLs

Microservices pg. 7
Video by 5 Minutes Tech "Microservices Explained in 5 Minutes"

- An architectural approach to building software applications as a collection of small and independent services focusing on a specific business capability
- Process:
  a. Developer breaks down all features and functions of the application into separate services.

Serverless Architecture pg.8 
  - Video by IBM "What is Serverless"
  - developers build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure
  - "build and run apps without thinking about services"
  - no server or code to manage
  - customer pays for execution time only (no idle time)

Video by IBM Technology "What is FaaS (Function as a Service)?

Funciton-as-a-Service (FaaS) pg. 9
- run code module (functions) of an application on the fly
- no concern for the backend infrastructure or system requirements

Backend as a Service (BaaS)
- entire backend (database, storage, etc.) of a system is handled independently and offered as a service

Infrastructure as Code (IoC)
- software engineering practice manages computing infrastructure using machine-readable definition files
- (On Test) Machine readable definition files written:
  1. YAML, JSON
  2. HCL (Hashcorp Configuration Language) used Terrafom/Consul
