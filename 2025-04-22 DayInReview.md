Routers get info from the network dynamically or statically. Static is when you manually/physically configure routers. Dynamic is when routers send router packets to routers instead of manual.
We started working today on Network Address Translation (NAT). Four (4) types of NAT addresses: Static (SNAT), Dynamic (DNAT), Port address translationS (pat), and Port forwarding. CloudStrike cybersecurity tool or another we will possibly go into later in the course.   
Sunny video NAT - SNAT, DNAT, PAT & Port Forwarding. Pat uses one (1) public IP address for a set of hosts.
Lesson 5.3 Network Address Translation allows private network to connect to the Intenet without using registered addressed for each host/node.
Generally, it is used to describe the process of translating private address to public addresses.
Edge Routers are located at the boundary of a network that connects to external networks (e.g., the Internet).
Fault tolerance is redundancy in the system. NAT is not a security mechanism; security is provided by the router/firewall's access control list (ACL).
