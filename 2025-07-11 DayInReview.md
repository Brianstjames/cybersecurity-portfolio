Admin. Identity "claim"
Authentication - "prove claim"
authorization - "rights & permission (access to files/folders)
Accounting - Auditing

PAM - privilege, access, management = users are root and administrator

- Single Sign-on Authentication (SSO)

- Kerberos - single sign-on through the use of tickets or tokens, time-stamping to defeat replay attacks, and symmetric encryption (instead of asymmetric encrytion).
 
Federation - networks under separate admin control share user accounts. pg. 10
a. Process - user (browser) request to service provider (SP)
b. Identity Provider (IdP): validates/vouches for the identity of a user/principal

1. principal attempts to access SP(service provider)/RP (Replying Party); SP redirects principle to Idp (Identity Provider) for authentication.
2. Principal authenticates with IdP; obtains ID attestation (token/doc) signed by IdP
3. Principal shows attestation to SP(service provider)/RP(replying party) who validates Id) signed.
4. SP/RP connects principal to its own account database
