Disaster Recovery (DRP) actions that stop incident and restore critical functions, provides structured approach to resume operations after an incident, and focuses on data and critical system availability.
Management theroy: Finance, accouting, operations and marketing = Business continuity plan (BCP).
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identify assests/processes critically important to operations.
Availability - percentage of time system is online.
DoS is denial of service.
Confidentiality (encryption), Integrity (no alteration/modification of data), and Availability (able for use) equals CIA triad).
High Availability system guarantees certains level of availability: always on always available. Redundacy for everything.
Video Five Nines (99.999%) Availability. The actual time you get to use it. Move operations to the cloud. Adequate bandwidth.
Video Professor Messer High Availabilty etc.
RTP vs. RPO video TechTarget. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) = amount of data loss that a system can sustain and measured in amount. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) = period following disaster that system is offline and maximum time allowed to identify issue recover (pg. 4, Lesson 7.4). RPO how much data can one one afford to lose? Use snapshots, etc.  RTO how long can one afford system to be down? Video  Network Solutions "Disaster Recovery Demystified".

Link Aggregation Control protocol (LACP) video What is IEEC (pg. 19 of slides)
(STC) spanning tree protocol - will not allow broadcast storm by lowest jack/port number automatically shutdown preventing loop. 
NIC Teaming is connecting two network interface cards.
Load Balancer (pg.20) slides distribute host request across group of two or more servers.

Cluster - Group of 2 or more integrated systems working at the same time to provide same service.
Jscape video Active-Active vs Active-Passive.
Module 8 Supporting Mgnt Network. The job is to protect assests. 
Baseline - (reference point) something used to compare (starting point) golden configuration - approved/authorized state.
nmap / Zenmap  - widely use for IP scanning.
Protocol Analyzer: Wireshark and tcpdump pg 9 of slide.
Quality of Service (QoS) - application requirements for high bandwidth and sensitivity to delay. VoIP and streaming are applicable here. Prioritizes traffic.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP old technology not supported by legacy systems)  Sunny Classroom video - framework for remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances. Agents
SNMP's goal is to "log events". SNMP Manager = centralized system for network monitoring and also known as a Network Managemnt Station. \
Mangement Information Base (MIB) hierarchical collection of managed resource informatin and organized into catetories (e.g., system, interface, IP, more pg.4); Ports UDP/161 (queries) and UDP/162 (traps)
Event Management Lesson 8.4 = Event Viewer & Windows Logs Video Logs = viewed via event viewing. Looking for audit failures.
