The first day of cybersecurity class was awesome. It started off with introductions from City of Refuge officers/staff and Npursuit Career Partners officers/staff.
Then we jumped straight into the program's Policies and Procedures.
After that we had lunch.
Then we played the two lies and one truth game to get to know each other a little.
After that we had guided study and was given our homework assignment.
