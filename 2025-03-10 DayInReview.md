Today we started studying Intro To Computers with instructor Darryl Davis.
Today was a day I am sure everyone in class was looking forward to.
We covered a lot of material but I believe we focused mainly on the components of the motherboard of the pc.
We learned about buses, operating systems, storage types, and much more.
