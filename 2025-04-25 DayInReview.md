Layer 2 vs Layer 3 Switches Powercert Video. Layer 3 switches can route data.
Lesson 5.6. Virtual Lans. Broadcast Domains - logical group of devices on the same data link netwoek can reach each other. Note: there are numerous types of broadcasts. 
Generally, all devices connected to a hub, bridge, and switch are in the same broadcast domain.
Multiple Broadcst Domains are two or more broadcast domains. 
Multiple broadcast domains are separated by a router or layer 3 switch.
VLANs - multiple VLANs within a switch are connected by a Layer 3 device (e.g. router).
Powercert VLAN video. Watching Sunny Classroom on VLAN video. Subnet vs VLANs Video Powercert video.
Layer 3 switch provides basic router and VLAN features.
Layer 3 switch interprets layer 3 packets usually faster, less expensive.
Layer 4 switch can interpret layer 4 datagrams and segments.
VLANs logically isolate connections with heavy or unpredictable traffic patterns (e.g., Voice over IP).
Devices on same VLAN have same subnet address.
Broadcast traffic is only transmitted on VLAN.

In IPv4 the addressing scheme is based on a 32-bit binary number. IP version 6 (IPv6) is designed to mitigate address exhaustion via a 128-bit addressing scheme which has space for 340 undecillion unique addresses.
