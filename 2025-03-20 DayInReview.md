On the 20th we discussed module 6 package management. We started with source code which is human readable program instructions.
The most common method for obtaining software for Linux is via the internet.
Files can be downloaded as source code or precompiled binary programs with file extensions like .exe and .dll.
The main advantage of source code is the ability to customize.
We also discussed precompiled and closed-source software.
Precompiled binary programs are already build from source with general features and parameters provided in the software. Easy to install and precompiled to run on certain hardware.
We discussed package managers like YUM, DNF, and APT which automatically install supporting (depenedant) software.
RPM, YUM and DNF are Red Hat package managers while dpkg, and APT are Debian distro package managers.
We also discussed some commands like ping, nslookup, wget, and curl.
