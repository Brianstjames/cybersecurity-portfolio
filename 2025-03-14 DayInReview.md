The first thing we did today was review so we talked about what a operating system does. 
A operating system acts as an intermediary between users, apps, and hardware ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
We reviewed VMware which is virtual machine like Ubuntu desktop and server on our machines - and CentOs.
We talked about different Linux GUIs like KDE, Unity, and Cinniman.
We discussed databases for a brief moment describing them as a table of information.
We discussed Linux commands such as pwd, echo, cat, cd, ls, touch, clear, whoami, ~.
We talked about storage technologies such as magnetic, ssd, and hybrid.
We discussed the Linux file system module 3.1 slide 4.
Blue denotes folders. White denotes files.
Then we went over more commands in the cli/terminal using mkdir, mv, cp, rm, cat, head, tail, ls -l, grep and etc.
