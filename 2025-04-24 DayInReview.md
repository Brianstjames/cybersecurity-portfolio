Reviewing Lesson 5.4 Firewalls. Firewalls filter traffic. They can work on traffic going in and going out. Firewalls are hardware, software, cloud-based, unified Threat Management (UTM).
Stateless inspection (
(ACL) access control list tells router to commit or deny traffic based of ip address, ...
Most firewalls use access control list.
Stateless and Stateful. Stateful maintain a record or state of packets that filter through. They analyze the entire packet. Situation between layer 3 and 4.
Stateless don't maintain memory as stateful. Relay of rules and ACL.
Stateful firewalls are more safe but heavy.
Firewalls can filter based on even keywords: granularity. Firewalls filter by port number, mac address, ip filtering or packet filtering, content filtering or information filtering, and Dynamic filtering or Stateful filtering (exams packets from head to toe, from layer 2 to layer 7).
UTM Unified Theat Management pg. 12 all-in-one security appliance. Single hardware/software provides multiple security functions.
Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) pg. 14 combines a traditional firewall with other network device filtering functionalities like an application firewall. 
Proxy Server (Sunny Classroom Video) (Powercert Video) pg. 20. Web Area Firewall (WAF). Logs user activity. Forwards requests and responses on behalf of its clients. Uses application-layer filtering. Placed at center of network. Process: deconstructs each packetk, performs analysis, and rebuilds the packet and forwards it on. retrieves data on behalf of the user. It affords privacy allowing you to hide your ip address. Safes bandwith stores ip address in its cache. 
VPN hides ip address and encrypts data and provides dedicated secure tunnel.
Proxy vs Reverse proxy (Powercert Video). Reverse proxy protects servers.
Lesson 5.1 Network Types. PAN persoal area network smartphones, etc. Sunny Video Network Types. WLAN wireless LAN. 
Network Types: PAN, LAN, WLAN, Campus Area Network (CAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Storage Area Network (SAN) - 
Ethernet is the layer 2 Data link protocol.
