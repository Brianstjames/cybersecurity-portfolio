Brute force attack is when one attempts password repeatedly is hacking method where an attacker systematicall tries all possible combinations of passwords, encryption keys, or login credentials until the correct one is found.
Rainbow attack is a type of cryptographic attack used to crack password hashes more efficiently than traditional brute force methods. It works by using precomputed tables (called rainbow tables) that map hash values back to their original plaintext passwords.
Dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack where an attacker tries to guess passwords or encryption keys by systematically testing words from a precompiled list (a "dictionary") instead of random combinations.
Today we are finishing up Lesson 9. CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Security Terms: Threat - harmful event. Vulnerability - weakness in system. Likelihood - probability/chance. Impact - value of threat ($$$). Risk: likelihood (%) and impact a threat will exploit vulnerability.
Compliance = laws and regulations, and standards.
Risk-Based audits = identifying and prioritizing potential threats/vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities to your assests. Test them.
GDPR - EU privacy law. European Union. (PCI DSS) Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - Credit card.
Risk Assessment Security Controls: "contermeasures" = techincal controls, administrative controls, and physical controls.

Cryptography - the study of hiding/encoding data (mathematical techniques to prevent data from being read/modified); secret writing. Three main types of algorithms (math formulas): hash, encryption (symmetric key, asymmetric key). 
First algorithm: Hash - algorithm executes math calculation on data  (purpose is integrity) 
Must known for Hash algorithms MD5 and the SHA family: SHA128, SHA256, SHA512.
Second algorithm is called Symmetric key - single key. Need to know RC4/5, AES, DES/3DES keys.
Hash Algorithms are non-reversible and fixed size. Sunny video
Symmetirc key encrption uses a singe private key (does the decrypting). Problem is getting other key to other party. 
Hash algorithm and Symmetric Key algorithms are first two crptographic algorithms dicussed.
(AES) Advanced Encryption Standard is the most widely used symmetic key algorithm today.
Hash utilizes integrity test and Symmetric single key does encryption/confidentiality.
Asymmetric algorithms use two keys. Public Key Encryption two keys public and private mathematical. Sunny Classroom video Public Key Encryption (Asymmetric Key Enryption)
Algorithms used to create public privates keys are RSA, DH, and Elliptic curve (ECC). 
Three states of data: rest not in use; data in use: and data in motion or data in transit. TechTarget video: three forms of data.
Dr. Messer video Vulnerabilities. Zero-day is vulnerability that hasn't been identified. Attack codes are used to eploit vulnerabilites. cve.mitter.org
Enumeration is gathering info about targets (fingerprint and footprint are enumeration).
Botnet (walking dead).
DoS - attack causes a service to become unavailable. Denial of service. DDos = coordinated attacks launched by multiple hosts simultaneously.
Malware and Ransomware Attacks are software that does something bad.
Fileless Malware no code on disk, hard to detect. Resides in memory, uses scripting tools Powershell, WMI.
Lesson 9.3 Spoofing Attacks. What is Spoofing (attacker disguises identity) = to pretend to be someone/something else.
Spoofing MAC, IP, ARP, and Email.
On-Path Attacks/spoofing aka man in the middle (MiTM).
Lesson 9.4 Rogue System Attacks - Rogue Devices - unauthorized hardware and software that is connected to a network without permission. Shadow IT is another term for rogue device.
Lesson 9.5 Social Engineering - convince someone into revealing confidential info. 
Tailgating - no consent. Piggybacking - consent.
Password Attacks - Password capture, Password hash cracking (Dictionary, Brute force).
