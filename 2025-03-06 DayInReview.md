Thursday was a fun day we learned about Intentional Learning which states that learning only happens when one gets sleep, one tells self it is important, and we are the stories we tell ourselves.
There are three (3) forms of learning build, redact, grow and mindfulness.
We discussed happiness.
And we talked about being indistractable.
