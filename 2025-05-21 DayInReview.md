Domain 1 - Networking Concepts - Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a network protocol that encrypts and authenticates data sent over a network. IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. 
IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authenticating the source where the packets come from.

Domain 4 - Network Security - 

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses ports 161 and 162, and it is a networking protocol used for the management and monitoring of network-connected devices in Internet Protocol networks. 
A trap - is an asynchronous notification from the agent to the manager. The trap is sent by the agent to notify the management of a significant event that is occuring in real-time, such as an alarming condition.
A verbose trap may containg all the information about about a given alert or event as its payload. A granular trap contains a unique object indentifier (OID) number and a value for that OID.
A verbose trap contains more information and data than a granular trap, and therefore requires more bandwidth to send the verbose trap over the network.
A unique objective identifier (OID) identifies a variable that can be read or set using the SNMP protocol.
The managemet information base (MIB) is a translatin file that is used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID).
