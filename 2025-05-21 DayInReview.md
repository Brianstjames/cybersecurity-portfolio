Reviewing for the Test on the 27 next week. On the Rise is going to present Financial Literacy Training by Mrs. Julia  at 9:30 am. Judy with on the rise is here for Setting Yourself Up fo Success: Maintaining Financial Resilience.

- Domain 1 - Networking Concepts - Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a network protocol that encrypts and authenticates data sent over a network. Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authenticating the source where the packets come from.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses ports 161 and 162, and it is a networking protocol used for the management and monitoring of network-connected devices in Internet Protocol networks. 
A trap - is an asynchronous notification from the agent to the manager. The trap is sent by the agent to notify the management of a significant event that is occuring in real-time, such as an alarming condition.
A verbose trap may containg all the information about about a given alert or event as its payload. A granular trap contains a unique object indentifier (OID) number and a value for that OID.
A verbose trap contains more information and data than a granular trap, and therefore requires more bandwidth to send the verbose trap over the network.
A unique objective identifier (OID) identifies a variable that can be read or set using the SNMP protocol.
The managemet information base (MIB) is a translatin file that is used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID).

- Virtual Machines - allow multiple applications to run on a single sever by simulating hardware and software. Each virtual machine has their own operating system. Hypervisor - is what allows one machine to run multiple virtual machines. It allocates and controls the sharing of a machines's hardware. Common hypervisors are VMware ESXi, Citrix XenServer, and Microsoft Hyper-V. They consume a lot of disk space, consume a lot of ram and cpu power, slow to startup, and require a license for each operating system.

- Container(s) - is an application that has been packaged with all the files, configurations, dependencies necessary (bundled with everything it needs such as libraries, html code, scripts, web images, and web server software) to run on any computer environment. They have smaller file size, therefor are light weight, lightning fast, and consume less ram, and cpu power. Disadvantages are they must be packaged to work with the same operating system of the server - Docker - is the software that is used to create, manage, and run containers. - Container Engine(s) - unpacks the container files and hands them off to the operating system kernel.

- LACP - Link Aggregation Control Protocol is a concept related to combining multiple physical network links into a single logical link to improve bandwidth, redundancy, and load balancing. pert. to port configuration status parameter. | - Tags understood by switches: (port tagging) untagged/tagged. Tag is a header which should be removed so packet is readable by endpoint (e.g. workstation).
