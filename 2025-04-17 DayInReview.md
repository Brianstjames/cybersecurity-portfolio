Mr. Darrl said the most difficult layer is the Network Layer 3. IP addresses.
Subnet mast determine what part of the IP address is the the network and hosts. IF the subnet mast octet is 255 it is network.
Mac Address is 48-Bit address, it is hexadecimal, the first 3 fields represent the manufacturer and the rest 3 fields represent the host computers.
Type ipconfig or ipconfig /all in terminal to view ip address, physical address/mac address and etc. 
The physical address is the MAC address.
127.0.0.0 defines the host computer your on at present.
Arp (video animated) resloves ip addresses to mac addresses. prompt command: arp -a
two diffent types of arp entries are static and dynamic

DHCP server (dora) mnemonic
NAT changes your ip address to your router's public address.
default gateway can be firewall 
dns resolves domain names to ip addresses.
ifconfig is the command for linux
169.254.0.1 - 169.254.254.254 Automatic private IP Adressing APIPA range Microsoft computers can communicate with each other this is a carve out. But now Linux is supporting it to Ubuntu.
APIPA means DHCP server is not working.
The last part of class we talke about Subnetting which consist of finding the Network ID and the Broadcast ID a given IP address.
Using the CIDR which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The process of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.
The main purpose of subnetting is to help relieve network congestion, improve performance, and improve security.
Subnet mask is used by a computer to determine if another computer (aka target) is on the same network or on a different network.
