IBM identity & Access Management (IAM) Video Identify (claim); Authentication (prove claim); Authorization (rights & privileges); Accounting (Logging,Auditing)
Lesson 10.2 guided study Four AAAA's: Administration - identity managing creating/deleting accouonts; Authentication -who are you; Authorization - are you allowed to do that or access management; and 4 Audit - check if you did the first three A's correctly.
Authorization = rights and permissions. Methods Discretionary access control (DAC) is about the owner of resource (file, folder, printer, webpage, db, firewall or asset) and who has permissions. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) what you do governs the files you can access: user = role = rights. Role activation happens after authenticaton.
RBAC - authorization based on tasks the user or service must be able to perform. Roles: set of right/permissions. Each principal (user or service account) is allocated to one or more roles. 
Security Group - (hybrid approach)?
Principle of least privilege - minimum rights and permissions.
Privileged Access Management (PAM) - control elevated access, e.g., of the Administrator or Root user; prevent privileged account abuse.
Top user in Linux is the Root user, in Windows it is Administrator.
Privilege Escalation - moving up for more rights and permissions.
Separation of Duties (video Utah office of state - separation of duties) divide tasks prevents ethical conflicts or abuse of power.
Zero Trust - (IBM video Why Zero Trust) untrusted, DMZ, trusted but should be untrusted, untrusted, untrusted.
Endpoint security, 
DHCP snooping protocol checks ALL DHCP info that passes thru switch and trusted/untrusted ports to protect DHCP server.
Hardening the switch controlling the jacks.
Lesson 10.5 Access Control list by default blocks all incoming packets unless configured otherwise. Impicit Deny - ?
Firewall is to filter. Stateless simply checks packet source  vs Statefull.
